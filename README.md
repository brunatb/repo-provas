# RepoProvas

This is a project in which you can send anonymous university exams and visualize already sent exams.

## How it works

In the front page, you have two options: send an exam or see existing exams. If you opt to see the already sent exams, you'll have to select if you wanna filter them by teacher or by subject. On each of these options you're presented with an overview of the amount of exams for each teacher/subject. Upon clicking on them, you can see the actual exams sent, that will be open on a new tab.

This is a full-stack project and you can find the back-end part [here].
